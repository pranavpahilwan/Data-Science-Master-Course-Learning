    "Here are some common regularization techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "--> L1 Regularization (Lasso):\n",
    "L1 regularization adds the sum of the absolute values of the model's coefficients to the objective function. This encourages sparsity in the model by shrinking some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection. The resulting model only retains the most important features, improving interpretability and reducing the risk of overfitting.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "--> L2 Regularization (Ridge):\n",
    "L2 regularization adds the sum of the squared values of the model's coefficients to the objective function. It penalizes large coefficient values, leading to a more spread-out distribution of feature weights. This technique tends to shrink all coefficients toward zero but does not set them exactly to zero. L2 regularization can help reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize.\n",

    "\n",
    "--> Elastic Net Regularization:\n",
    "Elastic Net regularization combines L1 and L2 regularization, adding both the sum of absolute values and the sum of squared values of the coefficients to the objective function. It provides a balance between feature selection (sparsity) and coefficient shrinkage. Elastic Net is useful when there are many correlated features, as it can select groups of correlated features together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "--> Dropout:\n",
    "Dropout is a regularization technique commonly used in neural networks. During training, random units (neurons) and their connections are temporarily \"dropped out\" or deactivated with a certain probability. This prevents individual neurons from relying too heavily on specific input features and encourages the network to learn more robust representations. Dropout helps prevent overfitting by introducing noise and promoting ensemble-like behavior among different sub-networks within the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "--> Early Stopping:\n",
    "Early stopping is a technique where model training is stopped before convergence based on the performance on a validation set. The model's performance on the validation set is monitored during training, and training is halted when the performance starts to deteriorate. This prevents the model from overfitting to the training data, as it stops learning when it starts to specialize too much."
